## Tweet-Support-Classifier
• Designed a Deep Learning model to classify tweet replies as supportive (+1), opposing (-1), or neutral (0).
• Assembled and processed a dataset of tweet-reply pairs, performing feature extraction and applying GloVe word embeddings for advanced deep neural networks to efficiently analyze textual content.
• Developed and evaluated a dual-input LSTM model (using Keras's functional API) and fine-tuned a pre-trained
BERT model from Transformers to assess sentiment.
